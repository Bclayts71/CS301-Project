For The first Milestone I did a couple of things to setup my environment for the project
1. I started by creating a Google Colab file, and cloning the python_for_microscopists.
2. Next I created my own repo for the project, where I then copied the seed 228_semantic_segmentation_of_aerial_imagery_using_unet.
3. In Google Colab I installed the NNI package. Then I unzipped the files and cloned the repo. After that, I setup a test NNI with my
credentials so that I could get a public url for the NNI UI. Below is a screenshot of my connection to the NNI Web UI.

4. After NNI, I installed and imported the Kaggle dataset for semantic segmentation.
5. The last thing I did to setup my environment was to download and import some of the dependencies I need. For now these
include: numpy, matplotlib, patchify, segmentation_models, tensorflow, and sklearn.
